This repository contains Python code for the work presented in the IROS 2021 paper "An Efficient Image-to-Image Translation HourGlass-based Architecture for Object Pushing Policy Learning" by M. Ewerton, A. Martínez-González and JM. Odobez.

In the folder "HourGlass_push_online_RL", the user will find code to train an HourGlass-based model to solve a push task, namely push objects so that they fall inside a box.

In the folder "HourGlass_push_TEST", the user will find code to test models.
